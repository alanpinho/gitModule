git reset = it can be --soft, --mixed or --hard

git reset --soft = The code will be back before the commit, the changes
and files will be available;

git reset --mixed = The code will be back before the commit and we will

again (git add -a (or -fileName));

after the commit will be deleted.

back again to commitHash to make new changes and repair bugs.
